Reason,Description
Conn-timeout,The connection ended when a flow is closed because of the expiration of its inactivity timer.
Deny Terminate,Flow was terminated by application inspection.
Failover primary closed,The standby unit in a failover pair deleted a connection because of a message received from the active unit.
FIN Timeout,Force termination after 10 minutes awaiting the last ACK or after half-closed timeout.
Flow closed by inspection,Flow was terminated by the inspection feature.
Flow terminated by IPS,Flow was terminated by IPS.
Flow reset by IPS,Flow was reset by IPS.
Flow terminated by TCP Intercept,Flow was terminated by TCP Intercept.
Flow timed out,Flow has timed out.
Flow timed out with reset,Flow has timed out but was reset.
Flow is a loopback,Flow is a loopback.
Free the flow created as result of packet injection,The connection was built because the packet tracer feature sent a simulated packet through the ASA.
Invalid SYN,The SYN packet was not valid.
IPS fail-close,Flow was terminated because the IPS card is down.
No interfaces associated with zone,Flows were torn down after the “no nameif” or “no zone-member” leaves a zone with no interface members.
No valid adjacency,This counter is incremented when the ASA tried to obtain an adjacency and could not obtain the MAC address for the next hop. The packet is dropped.
Pinhole Timeout,The counter is incremented to report that the ASA opened a secondary flow but no packets passed through this flow within the timeout interval and so it was removed. An example of a secondary flow is the FTP data channel that is created after successful negotiation on the FTP control channel.
Route change,When the ASA adds a lower cost (better metric) route packets arriving that match the new route cause their existing connection to be torn down after the user-configured timeout (floating-conn) value. Subsequent packets rebuild the connection out of the interface with the better metric. To prevent the addition of lower cost routes from affecting active flows you can set the floating-conn configuration timeout value to 0:0:0.
SYN Control,A back channel initiation occurred from the wrong side.
SYN Timeout,Force termination after 30 seconds awaiting three-way handshake completion.
TCP bad retransmission,The connection was terminated because of a bad TCP retransmission.
TCP FINs,A normal close-down sequence occurred. The IP address follows the reason.
TCP Invalid SYN,Invalid TCP SYN packet.
TCP Reset - APPLIANCE,The flow is closed when a TCP reset is generated by the ASA.
TCP Reset-I,Reset was from the inside.
TCP Reset-O,Reset was from the outside.
TCP segment partial overlap,A partially overlapping segment was detected.
TCP unexpected window size variation,A connection was terminated due to variation in the TCP window size.
Tunnel has been torn down,Flow was terminated because the tunnel is down.
Unauth Deny,An authorization was denied by a URL filter.
Unknown,An unknown error has occurred.
Xlate Clear,A command line was removed.
